    "Answere:-  In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exceptional condition is encountered, the Python interpreter raises an exception to signal that something went wrong. Exceptions can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as invalid input, unexpected behavior, or resource exhaustion.\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors are errors that occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that does not conform to the rules of the Python language. Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing stage and prevent the code from running altogether. These errors are typically caused by typos, missing parentheses, or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing stage, while exceptions occur during the execution of the program. In other words, syntax errors prevent the code from running, while exceptions can occur even if the code is syntactically correct.\n",
    "Another important difference is that syntax errors are usually easy to fix, as the interpreter provides a detailed error message that points to the exact location of the error. Exceptions, on the other hand, are often more difficult to fix, as they can be caused by a variety of factors and may require additional debugging and troubleshooting."
